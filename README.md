🧮 Text-to-Math Problem Solver using LangChain + Groq

This project implements an intelligent Text-to-Math Problem Solver that can understand mathematical problems written in natural language and provide accurate solutions using LangChain, Groq, and a built-in Calculator Tool.

It combines the reasoning ability of LLMs (Large Language Models) with the precision of a mathematical calculator — enabling users to type any math-related query in plain English and get both step-by-step reasoning and the final numerical answer.

🚀 Features

🧠 Converts natural language math problems into solvable expressions.

⚙️ Uses LangChain (v1.0.2) for modular AI architecture.

⚡ Powered by Groq API (ultra-fast inference with Llama 3.3).

🧮 Integrates a custom Calculator Tool for accurate arithmetic.

💬 Supports interactive chat for multi-turn problem-solving.

🧾 Outputs both reasoning steps and final answers clearly.

🧩 Example Interactions

User: I have 5 bananas and 7 grapes. I eat 2 bananas and give away 3 grapes.
Then I buy a dozen apples and 2 packs of blueberries (25 each).
How many total pieces of fruit do I have?

AI: You now have 69 pieces of fruit.

User: What is the area of a square with one side length = 4 cm?

AI: The area of the square is 16 square centimeters.

🧰 Core Components
1. LangChain

Used for building the agent and managing tool interactions seamlessly.

2. Groq Model

High-speed Llama 3.3 model for efficient reasoning and inference:

llm = ChatGroq(model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile", groq_api_key=os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY"))

3. Calculator Tool

Safely evaluates mathematical expressions generated by the LLM:

Tool(
    name="Calculator",
    func=lambda expression: eval(expression),
    description="Use this tool to perform arithmetic operations."
)

4. Agent Creation

Manages conversation flow, reasoning, and tool usage automatically to generate clear answers.
