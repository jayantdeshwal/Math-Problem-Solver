# 🧮 Text-to-Math Problem Solver using LangChain + Groq

This project implements an intelligent **Text-to-Math Problem Solver** that can **understand mathematical problems written in natural language** and provide accurate solutions using **LangChain**, **Groq**, and a built-in **Calculator Tool**.

It combines the reasoning ability of **LLMs (Large Language Models)** with the precision of a mathematical calculator — enabling users to type any math-related query in plain English and get both **step-by-step reasoning** and the **final numerical answer**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Converts **natural language math problems** into solvable expressions.
- ⚙️ Uses **LangChain (v1.0.2)** for modular AI architecture.
- ⚡ Powered by **Groq API** (ultra-fast inference with Llama 3.3).
- 🧮 Integrates a **custom Calculator Tool** for accurate arithmetic.
- 💬 Supports **interactive chat** for multi-turn problem-solving.
- 🧾 Outputs both **reasoning steps** and **final answers** clearly.

🧰 Core Components
🧩 1. LangChain
Used for building the agent and managing tool interactions seamlessly.

⚙️ 2. Groq Model
High-speed Llama 3.3 model for efficient reasoning and inference:

python
Copy code
llm = ChatGroq(model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile", groq_api_key=os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY"))
🧮 3. Calculator Tool
Safely evaluates mathematical expressions generated by the LLM:

python
Copy code
Tool(
    name="Calculator",
    func=lambda expression: eval(expression),
    description="Use this tool to perform arithmetic operations."
)
🧠 4. Agent Creation
Combines reasoning, calculator, and Wikipedia tools for multi-functional problem-solving.
